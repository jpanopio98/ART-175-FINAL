  <h1>ART 175 FINAL PROJECT</h1>
  <h2>Jedd Panopio</h2>
  <p>The prompt for this assignment is to create something that simulates viral growth using javascript. My inspiration for this project traces back to the
    very first website we had to deploy which was about social distancing. I created the assets via Illustrator and used very simple mechanics of P5.JS to create a game where the player must "social distance."</p>
